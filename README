This contains some android binaries we were recompiled with some patches to match the
required environment. Right now this are:

- libc: contains a patch (patches/bionic-pthread-tls.patch) for the use with libhybris

To rebuild this you need android build environment for (see
https://source.android.com/source/index.html). To recompile libc for example:

# source build/envsetup.sh
# lunch full-maguro_eng
# make BUILD_TINY_BIONIC=true libc
