This contains a complete android rootfs we need to setup the graphics acceleration
together with libhybris.

NOTE: This repository does not contain any properietary binaries from the nexus drivers
website (https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers). Everything part of this
repository is freely available as part of the AOSP source tree.

The android rootfs is based on android version 4.1.2_r1. The components that needs
to be patched are:

- libc: patches/bionic-pthread-tls.patch

To rebuild everything you need an android build environment (see
https://source.android.com/source/index.html).

To configure the build for the Galaxy Nexus device the execute the following steps:

NOTE: we have to build things twice as the linker binary is statically linked against the
libc library and it should not be linked against our modified one!

# source build/envsetup
# lunch full_maguro-userdebug
# (cd bionic && git apply bionic-pthread-tls.patch)
# make clean && make libc

Now you have to copy just the libc library from the build directory and put it into the
staging directory of this repository (path /system/bin).

# make clean
# (cd bionic && git reset --hard)
# make

After everything was sucessfully build the following files have to be copied over to the
statging directory of this repository (you will find all this files in the android device
build directory out/target/product/maguro/):
